- Almost never use the website.
  - Except for when I'm remote.

- Good for SEO, accessibility, and load performance.
  - I don't totally buy the load performance.
  - Many intelligent designs could alleviate issues with loading.
    - Bootstrapping data.
    - Lazy loading JavaScript that isn't used immediately.
    - Leverage caching.
    - Minify and static GZip (why isn't everyone always already doing this??)
